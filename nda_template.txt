If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

**12. COUNTERPARTS**

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

**13. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF**
